			  <p>Multipotent stem cells for transplant from bone marrow were used experimentally from the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960's with the work of Thomas and Storb and others, leading to stem cell transplant in the 1970's for hematologic malignancies. This work coined the term &ldquo;stem cell.&rdquo; The first human pluripotent cells were isolated in 1998 by Dr. James Thompson at the University of Wisconsin. These cells were isolated from excess embryos obtained from in-vitro fertilization clinics. Subsequently, scientists have isolated stem cells from a variety of adult tissues, but these are multipotent, not pluripotent.</p>
				<p>Adult stem cells have been found in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood. More recently, scientists have found stem cells in fat, skeletal muscle, skin, blood vessels, retina, liver, pancreas and the brain. Adult stem cells are extremely rare and difficult to identify, isolate and purify.</p>
