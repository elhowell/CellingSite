				<p> Before cell therapies move from basic research laboratories and into widespread use in the clinic, several technical obstacles must be overcome. Scientists must be able to:&nbsp;<br>
				  <br>
				  -Understand and control the mechanism of turning undifferentiated cells into specialized cells. This involves identifying the complex signals needed to turn the genes on and off that initiate and govern the differentiation of cells.<br>
				  -Identify, isolate and purify different adult stem cell types. Purified and/or expanded stem cells will be required for safe, efficacious treatments.<br>
				  -Control the differentiation of stem cells to target cell types needed to treat disease such that sufficient quantities of the correct stem cell or differentiated cell can be generated for treatment.<br>
				  -Learn to make stem cell transplants patient-compatible to avoid rejection by the immune system.<br>
				  -Demonstrate clinical improvement and normal cell development and function once stem cells have been transplanted into the patient&rsquo;s body. Stem cells must become integrated with the patient&rsquo;s own tissues and learn to function as one of the patient&rsquo;s natural body cells.<br>
				  <br>
				  Harnessing stem cells for use as drug delivery systems is another goal of researchers. Stem cells may be able to bring chemotherapeutic agents directly to the targeted cancerous cells. Stem cells may also be used to generate liver cells or other tissues that can be used in screening new drug candidates for safety in pharmaceutical drug development. Using human cells and/or tissues may provide a better model for toxicology testing than the traditional animal models in use today. Cancer vaccines, a type of adoptive immunotherapy, are in clinical trials for prostrate, breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers. Combining tumor cells from the patient with dendritic cells can lead to a vaccine that will seek out and destroy the cancerous cells. Other adoptive immunotherapies can artificially increase the number of T killer cells (a form of white blood cell) in a cancer patient. This involves collection of patient T cells, ex vivo expansion, then reinfusion to the patient. The result is an increase in the number of T cells and a stronger patient immune response to the cancer. <br>
