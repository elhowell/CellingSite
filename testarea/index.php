						<p>Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (born February 24, 1955) is an American business magnate and inventor. He is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. Jobs also previously served as chief executive of Pixar Animation Studios; he became a member of the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company in 2006, following the acquisition of Pixar by Disney. He was credited in the 1995 movie Toy Story as an executive producer.<br><br>
In the late 1970s, Jobs, with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Mike Markkula, and others, designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series. In the early 1980s, Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of the mouse-driven graphical user interface which led to the creation of the Macintosh. After losing a power struggle with the board of directors in 1984, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the higher education and business markets. Apple's subsequent 1996 buyout of NeXT brought Jobs back to the company he co-founded, and he has served as its CEO since 1997. <br><br>
In 1986, he acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd which was spun off as Pixar Animation Studios. He remained CEO and majority shareholder at 50.1% until its acquisition by The Walt Disney company in 2006. Consequently Jobs became Disney's largest individual shareholder at 7% and a member of Disney's Board of Directors.<br><br>
Jobs' history in business has contributed much to the symbolic image of the idiosyncratic, individualistic Silicon Valley entrepreneur, emphasizing the importance of design and understanding the crucial role aesthetics play in public appeal. His work driving forward the development of products that are both functional and elegant has earned him a devoted following.</p>

						<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist, and prominent leader in the African American civil rights movement. He is best known for being an iconic figure in the advancement of civil rights in the United States and around the world, using nonviolent methods following the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.[2] King is often presented as a heroic leader in the history of modern American liberalism.<br><br>
A Baptist minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career.[4] He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957, serving as its first president. King's efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech. There, he expanded American values to include the vision of a color blind society, and established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history.<br><br>
In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other nonviolent means. By the time of his death in 1968, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and stopping the Vietnam War.
King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and Congressional Gold Medal in 2004; Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986.</p>

						<p>David Farragut was born in Knoxville, Tennessee on 5th July, 1801. As a child he was adopted by Commodore David Porter of the US Navy. Farragut entered the navy as a Midshipman in 1810 and during the 1812 War served under Porter on the frigate Essex. Porter captured several British whaling vessels and at the age of twelve Farragut was given command of one of these prize ships. <br><br>

Farragut was sent to school for a while but by 1821 was an officer in the navy. He served in the West Indies under Porter and in 1824 was given his first independent command. He also saw action during the Mexican War (1846-48). <br><br>

During the secession crisis Farragut moved his wife and son from Norfolk, Virginia, and moved to the North. On the outbreak of the American Civil War Farragut was given command of the West Blockading Squadron. He led the New Orleans expedition in December, 1861. Farragut and his foster brother, David Porter, captured the forts guarding the port in April, 1862 and troops led by General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city soon afterwards. <br><br>

Promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral in July, 1862, Farragut he successfully opened up the Mississippi to Vicksburg. He was also involved in the campaign against Port Hudson and the assault on Mobile Bay (August to December, 1864). <br><br>

Farragut became America's first Vice Admiral on 23rd December, 1864. He was made a full admiral in 1866 and given command of the European Squadron. David Farragut died in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 14th August, 1870.</p>

						<p>James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist, and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA with Francis Crick, in 1953. Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". He studied at the University of Chicago and Indiana University and subsequently worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator and personal friend Francis Crick.<br><br>
In 1956, Watson became a junior member of Harvard University's Biological Laboratories, holding this position until 1976, promoting research in molecular biology. Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project. Watson has written many science books, including the seminal textbook The Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book The Double Helix (1968) about the DNA structure discovery.<br><br>
From 1968 he served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) on Long Island, New York, greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer. In 1994, he became its president for ten years, and then subsequently he served as its chancellor until 2007, when he resigned, due to a controversy over comments he made claiming black Africans were on average less intelligent than whites during an interview.</p>

                        Charismatic, outspoken and nicknamed "The Greatest," heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was the dominant heavyweight fighter of the 1960s and 1970s. A fighter of exceptional speed, cunning and flair, Ali won the world heavyweight title on three separate occasions over a span of 15 years. He was born Cassius Clay, and under that name he won a gold medal at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. 
      <br><br>After claiming his first title by defeating Sonny Liston in 1964, Clay joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. Citing his Islamic faith, Ali refused to serve in the U.S. military during the war in Vietnam; his title was revoked and he was sentenced to five years in prison for draft evasion. (The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the conviction in 1971.) He had a long-running rivalry with fellow heavyweight Joe Frazier, whom he fought three times: Ali lost the first match in 1971, but won rematches in 1974 and 1975. Ali also defeated George Foreman in the famous 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" held in Kinshasa, Zaire. Ali retired from boxing in 1981, but in the decades since has remained one of the world's best-known athletes.<br><br>

In retirement Ali has suffered from Parkinson's Disease, a motor-skills illness which has slowed his movement and left him mostly unable to speak in public... In 1996 he was selected to light the ceremonial flame at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, bringing him again into the public eye... Ali was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990... He won his three titles by defeating Sonny Liston (1964), George Foreman (1974) and Leon Spinks (1978)... Ali's managers sometimes refer to him as GOAT -- the Greatest Of All Time... Sprinter Wilma Rudolph won three gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, the same games at which Ali won his boxing gold.

						<p>Anita B. Roberts (April 3, 1942 – May 26, 2006) was a molecular biologist who made pioneering observations of a protein, TGF-ß, that is critical in healing wounds and bone fractures and that has a dual role in blocking or stimulating cancers. Roberts was the 49th most-cited scientist in the world and the second most-cited female scientist as of 2005.<br><br>

Roberts was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she grew up. She attended Oberlin College and earned her doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1968. After postdoctoral work at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Roberts joined the National Cancer Institute in 1976. From 1995 to 2004, she served as Chief of the institute's Laboratory of Cell Regulation and Carcinogenesis, and continued her research there until her death in 2006 by gastric cancer.
In the early-1980s, Dr. Roberts and her colleagues at the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland began to experiment with the protein, called TGF-ß, short for transforming growth factor beta.<br><br>

Dr. Roberts isolated the protein from bovine kidney tissue and compared her results with TGF-ß taken from human blood platelets and placental tissue. Institute researchers then began a series of experiments to determine the protein's characteristics. They discovered that it helps play a central role in signaling other growth factors in the body to heal wounds and fractures speedily. TGF-ß was later shown to have an effect on regulation of the heartbeat and the response of the eye to aging. <br><br>

In later research, Dr. Roberts and others found that TGF-ß inhibits the growth of some cancers while stimulating growth in advanced cancers, including cancers of the breast and lung.<br><br>

Dr. Roberts was a former president of the Wound Healing Society. In 2005, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Roberts herself was diagnosed cancer, stage IV gastric cancer, in March 2004. She received a degree of fame in the cancer community for her blog, detailing her daily struggles with the disease.</p>

He, Watson and Maurice Wilkins were jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material".<br><br>
Crick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the genetic code. He is widely known for use of the term “central dogma” to summarize an idea that genetic information flow in cells is essentially one-way, from DNA to RNA to protein.

						<p>First lady, writer, and humanitarian. Born on October 11, 1884, in New York City, New York. The niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor was known as a shy child and experienced tremendous loss at a young age. Her mother died in 1892. Two years later, Eleanor became an orphan at the age of 10 with the death of her father. She was sent to school in England as a teenager, an experience that help draw her out of her shell.<br><br>

In 1905 she married her distant cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. For Eleanor, the early years of her marriage were filled with family activities. The couple had six children: Anna, James, Franklin (who died as an infant), Elliott, Franklin Jr., and John. She did not let her growing family prevent her from helping others. During World War I, she became active in public service, working for the American Red Cross.<br><br>

After her husband suffered a polio attack in 1921, Eleanor stepped forward to help Franklin with his political career. When her husband became president in 1933, Eleanor dramatically changed the role of the first lady. Not content to stay in the background and handle domestic matters, she showed the world that the first lady was an important part of American politics. Eleanor gave press conferences and even had her own newspaper column entitled My Day. Eleanor spoke out for human rights, women's issues, and children's causes. She also wanted to help the country's poor and stood against racial discrimination.<br><br>

During World War II, Eleanor supported the war effort and traveled abroad to visit U.S. troops. After her husband's death in 1945, she was selected to be a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, serving from 1945 to 1953. She also became the chair of the UN's Human Rights Commission. As a part of this commission, she helped to write the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br><br>

Besides her political work, Eleanor also wrote several books about her life and experiences, including This Is My Story (1937), This I Remember (1949), On My Own (1958), and Autobiography (1961). She made a return to public service the same year her autobiography was published. President John F. Kennedy made her a delegate to the United Nations in 1961. He also selected her to serve as chair of the Commission on the Status of Women.<br><br>

Eleanor died of cancer on November 7, 1962. A revolutionary first lady, she was one of the most outspoken women to ever live in the White House. While she had her share of critics, most could agree that she was a great humanitarian who dedicated much of her life to fighting for what she thought was right.

						<p>Louis Pasteur's work on the link between bacteria and disease came to the attention of the famous Edinburgh surgeon Lord Lister. Lord Lister was concerned with the number of people who died after having operations in hospital. To combat infection, Lister introduced disinfectant sprays during operations, these prevented bacteria from entering a wound. He also introduced the use of dressings soaked in carbolic acid and strict hygiene rules to combat sepsis. The sterile methods introduced by Lister, drastically reduced the number of hospital deaths.<br><br>

In France at that time many cattle suffered from anthrax, a serious disease from which many of them died. Pasteur made a careful study of anthrax and noticed that some cows developed the disease more severely than others. So he decided to inject two cows with a strong dose of the anthrax bacteria, fully expecting them to die. To Pasteur's amazement neither of them developed the disease. Later, he found that both animals had already suffered from anthrax. Could they be immune to it? Could they be protected in some other way? Pasteur believed that if it were possible to give an animal a mild attack, this might be sufficient to prevent it from getting the disease later on.<br><br>

Eventually, after many experiments Pasteur succeeded in producing a weakened and harmless culture of anthrax bacteria. He inoculated cattle and sheep with this giving them a mild form from which they recovered. When these animals were put with others who had a severe form they remained unaffected. They were immune.<br><br>

Pasteur worked throughout the rest of his life on the various causes of diseases and how these could be prevented by vaccination.
Pasteur is particularly renowned for his work on the vaccine for rabies, a highly contagious infection which attacks the central nervous system. It enters the body through the bite of an infected animal or through infected saliva entering an existing wound. After experimenting with the saliva of animals suffering from the disease, Pasteur concluded that the disease rests in the central nervous system of the body. When an extract from the spinal column of an rabid dog was injected into healthy animals symptoms of rabies were produced. By studying the tissues of infected animals- rabbits, Pasteur was able to produce an attenuated form of the virus. This could be used for inoculation.<br><br>

On July 6 1885, Pasteur tested his pioneering rabies vaccine on man for the first time. He saved the life of a young man called Joseph Meister who had been bitten by a rabid dog. Pasteur was urged to treat him with his new method. The treatment lasted 10 days and at the end he recovered and remained healthy. Since then thousands have been saved by this treatment.</p>
