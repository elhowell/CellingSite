				<p>The FDA defines cell therapy as, &ldquo;The prevention, treatment, cure or mitigation of disease or injuries in humans by the administration of autologous, allogeneic or xenogeneic cells that have been manipulated or altered ex vivo.&rdquo;1 The goal of cell therapy, overlapping with that of regenerative medicine, is to repair, replace or restore damaged tissues or organs.</p>
                <p>Cell therapy may take the form of a stem cell transplant such as a hematopoietic cell transplant that is used to restore the blood and immune system of patients with leukemia, lymphoma or other blood disorders.<br>
                  Activation of the body&rsquo;s own immune system to fight cancer is referred to as adoptive immunotherapy. This type of cell therapy is most commonly used in the fight against cancer. One type of adoptive immunotherapy treatment artificially increases the number of T killer cells (a form of white blood cell) in the patient and involves collection of patient T cells, ex vivo expansion, then reinfusion to the patient. The result is an increase in the number of T cells and a stronger patient immune response to the cancer.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the type of cellular therapy, production of the therapeutic product may require several complex techniques to alter or manipulate the cell. Cell engineering techniques may include:<br>
                  <br>
  &bull;	Propagation of cells<br>
  &bull;	Expansion of cells<br>
  &bull;	Selection of cells<br>
  &bull;	Pharmacological treatment of cells<br>
  &bull;	Alteration of biological characteristics of cells<br>
                </p>
