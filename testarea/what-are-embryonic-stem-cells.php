			<div class="right">
				<p>Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos, specifically the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, a hollow ball of cells that forms approximately five days after conception. Embryonic stems cells are the most primitive stem cells and as a result contain the most long-term promise for novel cell therapies and tissue regeneration.</p>
				<p>Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, meaning they have the ability to differentiate into any of the 200-plus cell types required by the body. Understanding and controlling embryonic stem cell differentiation and growth will require years of intensive research. Growing these cells in the laboratory is a time-consuming and painstaking process. Scientists must monitor embryonic stem cells closely and provide constant care to ensure continued growth and prevent uncontrolled or spontaneous differentiation.</p>
				<p>Most embryonic stem cells used for research today have been donated from excess blastocysts created during in-vitro fertilization. The University of Wisconsin-Madison presents fascinating images on their Stem Cell Research web site.</p>
